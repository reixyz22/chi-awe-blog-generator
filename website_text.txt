So far, I’ve spent over 50 hours with the young Dragons and I absolutely love seeing them active and excited to be playing together. I hope the kids have learned teamwork and stay fit when playing, while having fun of course.\xa0I have many years of experience sewing and I have a fashion line Tanjerine Studios where I do a lot of up-cycling of treasured family quilts.

By which I mean, healing requires all hand on deck, so trust the flow and speed of the community which sometimes means relinquishing control for how we expect things “should be.”Thanks to the Night Market cohosted by ChiAWE from last year, I was able to meet Andrew Jin Hong.

I entered the process feeling insecure about my body, learning to reframe them, and proudly strutting on stage to proclaim my platform to show all bodies are beautiful. Because I opened up about my struggle with body image, those who resonated felt heard. Now as a titleholder, I want to help others be victoriously vulnerable in sharing their stories. My workshop on Loving Your Body helped participants experience the steps of opening up about their challenges and reframing it literally and figuratively through storytelling and art. There is power in saying your struggles out loud, which may results in an emotional release. There were participants who shed tears and those who admitted to never have shared that particular body insecurity story. However, workshops happen at certain points in time and not everyone can attend. I wanted to make that environment accessible anytime, anywhere. Therefore, I launched my podcast Victoriously Vulnerable so that our stories are captured in a supportive space.

I was lucky enough to have strong Asian female role models during my formative years. They helped me define my identity as a Chinese American woman and set an example of giving back. After being involved with the community since I was young, I’m now confident in my ability to influence others just as my mentors had impacted me.I hope to give other young women like myself the opportunity to have role models, guidance, mentorship, and training. I believe it’s crucial to have a set goal and a public presentation of the culmination of their hard work and learning experience. My answer to that was the Miss Chinese Chicago pageant, now Miss Asian Chicago.In 2011, at the age of 19, I competed in my first pageant in order to prove to myself that I could do it. After that, I was hooked. I competed in many pageants until 2017, and then officially retired from pageantry. Through the years, I’ve gained a set of pageant sisters, self-presentation skills, self-confidence, and a platform to give back to my community. I hope to give an even better opportunity to other young women in the community through the Miss Asian Chicago Community and Heritage Pageant (formerly Miss Chinese Chicago pageant).\n', '\nOperated by 501c3 non-profit Chicago Asian Women Empowerment \n', '\nPolicies\n', '\nAbout\n', '\nContact\n'], ('Contact', 'https://www.missasianchicago.info/contact'): [], ('', 'https://www.misschinesechicago.info/2022-court'): ['\n\xa0\n', '\nMy name is Xiao “Lin” Mei and I am your Miss Chinese Chicago 2022 Queen and Miss Crowd Favorite!

I can’t even put into words how it felt to be able to share the stage with 8 other many amazing ladies I can proudly call my pageant sisters.
