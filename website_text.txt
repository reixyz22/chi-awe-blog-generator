Raised $500 for Project:VISION“Ever since I was young, soccer and sewing have played a huge part of my life. They’ve helped me get through the most difficult times. I want to share that passion with others. Soccer is an accessible sport and currently there are no programs teaching soccer to kids in the Chinatown area. And up-cycling is becoming more trendy because it’s eco-friendly.I’ve developed a curriculum and have the Chicago Dragons as a partner in executing the soccer program. So far, I’ve spent over 50 hours with the young Dragons and I absolutely love seeing them active and excited to be playing together. I hope the kids have learned teamwork and stay fit when playing, while having fun of course.\xa0I have many years of experience sewing and I have a fashion line Tanjerine Studios where I do a lot of up-cycling of treasured family quilts. To share this passion with others, I hosted a thrifting and sewing workshop with the Young Women Warriors and a Women Empowerment series workshop. It was so nice seeing everything’s works in progress and seeing how they were able to learn the basic skills needed to mend their clothes and alter them into new items that they love and that fit them better!” - Jean Elliott\n', '\nCommunity Platform HighlightMiss Chinatown USA 2023 Community Service and 2022 Miss Chinese Chicago contestant - Mia HittermanActive Listening, Speech Impediments, and Art Healing\n', '\nPlatform:  Build an inclusive world where everyone can speak and be heard.Came into the pageant as a Marketing and Communications Student Coordinator with Dominican University’s Center for Cultural Liberation and co-chair of APIDA.Led an AAPI Women Empowerment Series Workshop teaching Active Listening and sharing my story growing up teaching others how to support me with my Speech Impediment.Co-developed and co-hosting a healing collaborative interactive art project with KANWIN.“As a student, I feel a great responsibility to promote inclusive spaces so that everyone can speak without hesitation.

Plans to lead healing circles in the future.“I completed my healing circle training with We Each Belong and officially a Circle Keeper, but this is just the beginning as the work towards inclusion is evergreen. I’ve learned a lot about the sacredness towards each other, value of community in relationship building, both individual and collective wellness is rooted in the success of one another.If I had to take one lesson from healing circles is that radical healing requires active embrace of slowness and active listening. By which I mean, healing requires all hand on deck, so trust the flow and speed of the community which sometimes means relinquishing control for how we expect things “should be.”Thanks to the Night Market cohosted by ChiAWE from last year, I was able to meet Andrew Jin Hong. Turns out the work I was doing in high school in 2015 on the CPS CEO’s Student Advisory Council jump started the restorative justice practice Andrew is now leading inside the schools.

I entered the process feeling insecure about my body, learning to reframe them, and proudly strutting on stage to proclaim my platform to show all bodies are beautiful. Because I opened up about my struggle with body image, those who resonated felt heard. Now as a titleholder, I want to help others be victoriously vulnerable in sharing their stories. My workshop on Loving Your Body helped participants experience the steps of opening up about their challenges and reframing it literally and figuratively through storytelling and art. There is power in saying your struggles out loud, which may results in an emotional release. There were participants who shed tears and those who admitted to never have shared that particular body insecurity story. However, workshops happen at certain points in time and not everyone can attend. I wanted to make that environment accessible anytime, anywhere. Therefore, I launched my podcast Victoriously Vulnerable so that our stories are captured in a supportive space. Together, we can begin and continue our journeys of being victoriously vulnerable as we accept ourselves and share our stories.” - Victoria Li\n', '\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\n', '\nChicago Asian Women Empowerment is a not-for-profit organization with 501c3 status.

Throughout this pageant journey, I’ve experienced many kindness from my pageant sisters. During this whole experience, the support was real.”— Julie Zheng, 2019 Contestant\n', '\nBelow is an excerpt from 2019 Miss Chinese Chicago contestant Julie Zheng’s Medium articleI remember a pageant sister that was so informative that every time I asked a question, she always answers it with fun facts. I learned a lot of interesting facts through her.I remember a pageant sister that told me, “You did a lot better!” after watching me improve on my public speaking skills. I needed that reassurance that I am improving and I’m not the only one thinking that.I remember on the day of our press conference, I struggled walking in my wrong sized heels. One of my pageant sisters realized my struggle and was willing to patiently wait for me.I remember a pageant sister that was willing to initiate and get to personally know me outside the pageant process. I truly appreciate it.I remember going to my rehearsals early on Saturday mornings and being asked, “How are you doing?”. It’s always a nice feeling when someone asks how I am doing?I remember sharing my nervousness with a pageant sister and she was able to relate. She let me know, I’m not alone.I remember a pageant sister passing out each and every one a cute card. It was such a kind gesture.I remember being surprised by one of my pageant sisters who always gave me a hug as a greeting and I thought in my head, “Wow, she is a hugger! Who knew?”.I remember a pageant sister who shared her feelings and concerns throughout the pageant. She made me feel important and helpful as a 姐妹.You noticed I remember these 9 moments? Each moment is about my interaction with my different pageant sisters. No matter how small these words and gestures seem to others, I personally felt that every one of them matter to me.

From World Peace to World Trade.\n', '\nI stumbled out of the darkness, pulling myself together for corporate America once again, alone.A weekend following my on-site project, I was at our pageant rehearsal practicing my community concern speech. I heard myself proudly speak of being the sole female Asian American engineer in my department, and I immediately felt like a fraud. To make matters worse, my platform was empowering professional women. How was supposed to empower other women when I could barely empower myself to stand up for my credibility as an engineer?In an offline conversation after that rehearsal, one of my pageant sisters shared with me that she was feeling like a fraud. She told me while she was preaching self-confidence in her community concern speech, she was struggling through a messy breakup. I shared that I also felt like an imposter; from that shared moment of vulnerability, we started texting more frequently the following week to check in on each other.\xa0\n', '\nBelow is an excerpt from 2019 Miss Chinese Chicago Queen Pamela Yuan’s Medium articleI don’t think I have ever been in a more alone point in my life.My sobs echoed in the dark warehouse restroom, this was the only place I could hide to be alone, even though ironically, feeling alone was the feeling I was trying to escape. I was the sole female, from the operations engineering team, on this project to erect a 1.3 million square foot warehouse. While I was helping the warehouse team make the drastic efficiency improvements to their billion dollar warehouse, the warehouse workers and managers were simultaneously tearing down my professional confidence with comments of appreciation about my appearance as an exotic Asian girl and my olive skin tone instead of comments on my abilities and competence as an engineer.When I finally mustered enough confidence to stand back up from the toilet seat to wash my hands and clean myself up, I found that the water and the lights did not work.

Miss Chinese Chicago 2018 was the fourth pageant I competed in, and it was also the pageant that I witness myself grow the most. Because of our founder and producer  Victoria Ng, I was able to get out of my comfort zone and be unapologetically myself. Before I would always try to mold myself to be the "perfect Chinese" woman that society wanted me to be, but after training hours on end with Victoria, she made me realize that I felt the most beautiful and confident when I was myself. \n', '\n6.

In the 2019 Miss Chinese Chicago pageant, I had the honor to train ten beautiful woman who are leaders in Chicago.
