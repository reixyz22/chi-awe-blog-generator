Winner at heart.\n', '\n“Pageantry taught me that sisterhood is about respecting each other, thinking about one another, and celebrating our wins together. Throughout this pageant journey, I’ve experienced many kindness from my pageant sisters. During this whole experience, the support was real.”— Julie Zheng, 2019 Contestant\n', '\nBelow is an excerpt from 2019 Miss Chinese Chicago contestant Julie Zheng’s Medium articleI remember a pageant sister that was so informative that every time I asked a question, she always answers it with fun facts. I learned a lot of interesting facts through her.I remember a pageant sister that told me, “You did a lot better!” after watching me improve on my public speaking skills. I needed that reassurance that I am improving and I’m not the only one thinking that.I remember on the day of our press conference, I struggled walking in my wrong sized heels. One of my pageant sisters realized my struggle and was willing to patiently wait for me.I remember a pageant sister that was willing to initiate and get to personally know me outside the pageant process. I truly appreciate it.I remember going to my rehearsals early on Saturday mornings and being asked, “How are you doing?”. It’s always a nice feeling when someone asks how I am doing?I remember sharing my nervousness with a pageant sister and she was able to relate. She let me know, I’m not alone.I remember a pageant sister passing out each and every one a cute card. It was such a kind gesture.I remember being surprised by one of my pageant sisters who always gave me a hug as a greeting and I thought in my head, “Wow, she is a hugger! Who knew?”.I remember a pageant sister who shared her feelings and concerns throughout the pageant. She made me feel important and helpful as a 姐妹.You noticed I remember these 9 moments? Each moment is about my interaction with my different pageant sisters. No matter how small these words and gestures seem to others, I personally felt that every one of them matter to me. Cheers to sisterhood!\n', '\n3. Supporting other women.\n', '\n4. From World Peace to World Trade.\n', '\nI stumbled out of the darkness, pulling myself together for corporate America once again, alone.A weekend following my on-site project, I was at our pageant rehearsal practicing my community concern speech. I heard myself proudly speak of being the sole female Asian American engineer in my department, and I immediately felt like a fraud. To make matters worse, my platform was empowering professional women. How was supposed to empower other women when I could barely empower myself to stand up for my credibility as an engineer?In an offline conversation after that rehearsal, one of my pageant sisters shared with me that she was feeling like a fraud. She told me while she was preaching self-confidence in her community concern speech, she was struggling through a messy breakup. I shared that I also felt like an imposter; from that shared moment of vulnerability, we started texting more frequently the following week to check in on each other.\xa0\n', '\nBelow is an excerpt from 2019 Miss Chinese Chicago Queen Pamela Yuan’s Medium articleI don’t think I have ever been in a more alone point in my life.My sobs echoed in the dark warehouse restroom, this was the only place I could hide to be alone, even though ironically, feeling alone was the feeling I was trying to escape. I was the sole female, from the operations engineering team, on this project to erect a 1.3 million square foot warehouse. While I was helping the warehouse team make the drastic efficiency improvements to their billion dollar warehouse, the warehouse workers and managers were simultaneously tearing down my professional confidence with comments of appreciation about my appearance as an exotic Asian girl and my olive skin tone instead of comments on my abilities and competence as an engineer.When I finally mustered enough confidence to stand back up from the toilet seat to wash my hands and clean myself up, I found that the water and the lights did not work. Of course making sure the female restroom was fully working was not a priority…\n', '\n5.

My name is Jamie Moy, and I was MIss Chinese Chicago First Princess 2018 and am the current Miss Friendship Ambassador 2020. Miss Chinese Chicago 2018 was the fourth pageant I competed in, and it was also the pageant that I witness myself grow the most. Because of our founder and producer  Victoria Ng, I was able to get out of my comfort zone and be unapologetically myself. Before I would always try to mold myself to be the "perfect Chinese" woman that society wanted me to be, but after training hours on end with Victoria, she made me realize that I felt the most beautiful and confident when I was myself. \n', '\n6.

Now I am a pageant contestant turned associate board member turned pageant trainer and Miss Chinese Chicago Board Member. In the 2019 Miss Chinese Chicago pageant, I had the honor to train ten beautiful woman who are leaders in Chicago. I completely believe in Victoria's mission in making an impact in our Chinese population and city, so what used to be a one woman team of only Victoria is now a tag team.\n", '\nIn coordination with Asian Justice Movement, we hosted “Break the Silence: Justice for Asian Women”.

I am so lucky to have so many supportive people who have faith in me even while I struggle to believe in myself. The Miss Crowd Favorite award is symbolic to me as it represents the community coming forward to show love for racial solidarity in Chinatown and love for me.Miss Chinese Chicago pageant has truly been an incredible experience, and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to be a part of such a vibrant event and be part of a healing sisterhood. I can’t even put into words how it felt to be able to share the stage with 8 other many amazing ladies I can proudly call my pageant sisters. There were many instances of support these ladies provided throughout the pageant. I went on a double date, had nights out dancing, cried over the phone, and sought and received affirmation and advice. Most importantly, my pageant sisters and pageant producer, Victoria Ng, empowered me to follow my guts and trust my intuition. I gained the confidence to stand up for what I believe in and challenge the status quo despite having fear of falling off the stage and being ostracized. Fortunately, I did not fall off!\xa0As your 2022 Queen I am ready to execute my platform of racial healing and solidarity to create a positive impact and unite our greater Chinatown communitiesI will treasure these two titles with all my soul. I look forward to all the future partnerships and hope to see you at one of our community events.Xiao Lin Mei\n', '\nWhen I entered Miss Chinese Chicago, my goals were to:Make friends with fantastic Chinese women and hopefully a few role modelsLearn more about myself and what I valuePolish my public speaking skills, posing, and poiseLearn more about the Chinese communityI did not think I would win any titles. I am so humbled to be your First Princess. And even more humbled to be surrounded by the truly incredible women that make up the 2022 Court. I cannot wait to keep learning from them, as well as my other pageant sisters. They are truly, each and every one, my role models and mentors.This experience helped me hone in on my vocation: animal welfare. I will continue this mission as I manage patient care as a veterinary assistant, volunteer with animal welfare organizations, and reduce my carbon footprint. The summer of 2022 is when I submitted my veterinary school applications, so I will find out if I can become a veterinarian and make an even bigger difference this spring!For the last two goals, I am continually working on my public speaking and poise, especially when it comes to discussing my heritage. As a biracial kid growing up in mostly white spaces with Chinese grandparents that don’t like to talk about the pain of the past, Miss Chinese Chicago truly introduced me to the Chicago AAPI community. I look forward to growing as a community member to better serve you in the next year.With unending gratitude,Natalie Chin\n', '\nI\'m so proud to represent curvier Asian American women as your Miss Chinese Chicago 2022 Second Princess!

Jean Elliott here and I am SO excited to be your Miss Chinese Chicago’s Miss Con(Jean)iality of 2022.\xa0 As a transracial Chinese adoptee, I didn’t have the opportunity to grow up with a consistent Chinese community. When I moved to Chicago I proactively immersed myself in a community that I found within Chinatown and Miss Chinese Chicago. The friendship, joy, and support that I found from contestants, Lin, Kim, Ava, Mary, Victoria, Natalie, Mia, and Isabel is beyond words!\xa0Even though my parents could not personally offer me a community that looked like me, they cleared the path for me to find strength in other paths like soccer and sewing. These two activities have always been strong pillars in my personal foundation. I plan on using both activities to continue to uplift myself and the community that I now have the privilege of being a part of. I hope to bring that same love and support I received from the other contestants and the strength I have found through soccer and sewing to the greater Chinese community as your 2022 Miss Congeniality.Jean Elliott\n', '\nThe Miss Chinese Chicago was founded by Victoria M.
