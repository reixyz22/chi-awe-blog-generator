Because of our founder and producer Victoria Ng, I was able to get out of my comfort zone and be unapologetically myself. Before, I would always try to mold myself to be the "perfect Chinese woman" that society wanted me to be, but after training hours on end with Victoria, she made me realize that I felt the most beautiful and confident when I was myself.""What started as a challenge to push myself outside of my comfort zone became an avenue for me to gain both a sisterhood of strong and resilient women and a platform to empower Chinese individuals to better understand and manage their health. As a physician-in-training, this opportunity to engage with the Chinese community in a way that allows them to lead healthier lives is invaluable, and I don’t take it for granted."\n\n\n\nMegan Wu\n\n2019 Miss Chinese Chicago First PrincessBrittany Lau\n2018 Miss Chinese Chicago Queen & Congeniality\n2019 Miss Chinatown USA Community Service & Congeniality\n\n\n\n"I have seen myself slowly grown into a woman I’d never imagine I’d become: a person who is confident in her own skin, voices out for what she is passionate about, and most importantly, an active female Chinese American community leader who is making a difference."Although it seemed like a small gesture, I was reminded that even though I felt alone at work, because of my ethnicity and gender, I was not alone in the fight for women’s empowerment. With her encouragement, and kindness from my pageant director, I reported the cases of sexual harassment to my manager. With the confidence I gained from this experience, I started to consider applying for a role at a company where would my abilities as a female Asian American engineer would be celebrated, not just tolerated."\n\n\nPamela Yuan\n\n2019 Miss Chinese Chicago QueenAlly Moraga\n2019 Asian Fashion Show Chicago Model\n\n"I felt immensely supported by this community as well as by the coordinators of the event.

But Miss Chinese Chicago, now Miss Asian Chicago, is not a beauty pageant. It\'s an empowering experience that strengthens you in public speaking, poise, knowledge of Asian American issues, connection with Chicago Asian American community, and sisterhood."\nVictoria Li\n\n2022 Miss Chinese Chicago Second Princess & Talent"Pageantry taught me that sisterhood is about respecting each other, thinking about one another, and celebrating our wins together. Throughout this pageant journey, I’ve experienced many kindness from my pageant sisters. During this whole experience, the support was real."\n\nJulie Zheng\n\n2019 Miss Chinese Chicago Contestant\nRead Julie\'s Medium Article"Before Miss Chinese Chicago (now Miss Asian Chicago) I’d never considered myself “pageant material.” In my head, “pageant girls” always wore lots of makeup and had to give their looks painstaking attention - something I have very little interest in. But with Miss Asian Chicago, I can come exactly as I am. Victoria and everyone else in the process - including my amazing pageant sisters - created a supportive space for me to be my messy self while I learned more about my values and polished my presentation skills. If you’re not interested in making more friends in the Asian community, if you’re not willing to go outside your comfort zone and learn, Miss Asian Chicago is not for you. But if you’re ready to grow and learn more about yourself, submitting that application is going to be a turning point in your life. That’s what this experience has been for me."\nNatalie Chin\n\n2022 Miss Chinese Chicago First Princess"I remember the day before the Miss Chinese Chicago pageant, and I was feeling insecure about being intimidating to the judges since I have such a strong work history for Chinatown. However, a pageant sister, Natalie Chin, came up and talked to me about reframing and reclaiming ownership of the word intimidating as a powerful woman. There were many instances of support these ladies provided throughout the pageant. I went on a double date, had nights out dancing, cried over the phone, sought and received affirmation and advice, and my emotional and physical safety was always prioritized. These instances were not only inspiring but absolutely healing for me. I hold these lessons and affection dear to my heart as I am now the 2022 Queen of Miss Chinese Chicago and will proceed in fulfilling my platform of racial healing in the greater Chinatown area."\nXiao Lin Mei\n\n2022 Miss Chinese Chicago Queen & Crowd Favorite"MCC has taught me the importance of friendship, giving back, and supporting each other. Thank you to everyone for believing in me and supporting me here today! After MCC, I will continue my work of empowering and educating the next generation of future leaders."\nMia Hitterman\n2022 Miss Chinese Chicago Contestant\n2023 Miss Chinatown USA Community Service']}
