I hope the kids have learned teamwork and stay fit when playing, while having fun of course.\u00a0I have many years of experience sewing and I have a fashion line Tanjerine Studios where I do a lot of up-cycling of treasured family quilts. To share this passion with others, I hosted a thrifting and sewing workshop with the Young Women Warriors and a Women Empowerment series workshop.

I entered the process feeling insecure about my body, learning to reframe them, and proudly strutting on stage to proclaim my platform to show all bodies are beautiful. Because I opened up about my struggle with body image, those who resonated felt heard. Now as a titleholder, I want to help others be victoriously vulnerable in sharing their stories. My workshop on Loving Your Body helped participants experience the steps of opening up about their challenges and reframing it literally and figuratively through storytelling and art. There is power in saying your struggles out loud, which may results in an emotional release. There were participants who shed tears and those who admitted to never have shared that particular body insecurity story. However, workshops happen at certain points in time and not everyone can attend. I wanted to make that environment accessible anytime, anywhere. Therefore, I launched my podcast Victoriously Vulnerable so that our stories are captured in a supportive space.

To make matters worse, my platform was empowering professional women. How was supposed to empower other women when I could barely empower myself to stand up for my credibility as an engineer?In an offline conversation after that rehearsal, one of my pageant sisters shared with me that she was feeling like a fraud. She told me while she was preaching self-confidence in her community concern speech, she was struggling through a messy breakup.

I was the sole female, from the operations engineering team, on this project to erect a 1.3 million square foot warehouse. While I was helping the warehouse team make the drastic efficiency improvements to their billion dollar warehouse, the warehouse workers and managers were simultaneously tearing down my professional confidence with comments of appreciation about my appearance as an exotic Asian girl and my olive skin tone instead of comments on my abilities and competence as an engineer.When I finally mustered enough confidence to stand back up from the toilet seat to wash my hands and clean myself up, I found that the water and the lights did not work.

After being involved with the community since I was young, I\u2019m now confident in my ability to influence others just as my mentors had impacted me.I hope to give other young women like myself the opportunity to have role models, guidance, mentorship, and training. I believe it\u2019s crucial to have a set goal and a public presentation of the culmination of their hard work and learning experience. My answer to that was the Miss Chinese Chicago pageant, now Miss Asian Chicago.In 2011, at the age of 19, I competed in my first pageant in order to prove to myself that I could do it. After that, I was hooked. I competed in many pageants until 2017, and then officially retired from pageantry. Through the years, I\u2019ve gained a set of pageant sisters, self-presentation skills, self-confidence, and a platform to give back to my community.
