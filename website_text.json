I am so lucky to have so many supportive people who have faith in me even while I struggle to believe in myself. The Miss Crowd Favorite award is symbolic to me as it represents the community coming forward to show love for racial solidarity in Chinatown and love for me.Miss Chinese Chicago pageant has truly been an incredible experience, and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to be a part of such a vibrant event and be part of a healing sisterhood. I can\u2019t even put into words how it felt to be able to share the stage with 8 other many amazing ladies I can proudly call my pageant sisters. There were many instances of support these ladies provided throughout the pageant. I went on a double date, had nights out dancing, cried over the phone, and sought and received affirmation and advice. Most importantly, my pageant sisters and pageant producer, Victoria Ng, empowered me to follow my guts and trust my intuition. I gained the confidence to stand up for what I believe in and challenge the status quo despite having fear of falling off the stage and being ostracized. Fortunately, I did not fall off!\u00a0As your 2022 Queen I am ready to execute my platform of racial healing and solidarity to create a positive impact and unite our greater Chinatown communitiesI will treasure these two titles with all my soul. I look forward to all the future partnerships and hope to see you at one of our community events.Xiao Lin Mei\n", "\nWhen I entered Miss Chinese Chicago, my goals were to:Make friends with fantastic Chinese women and hopefully a few role modelsLearn more about myself and what I valuePolish my public speaking skills, posing, and poiseLearn more about the Chinese communityI did not think I would win any titles. I am so humbled to be your First Princess. And even more humbled to be surrounded by the truly incredible women that make up the 2022 Court. I cannot wait to keep learning from them, as well as my other pageant sisters. They are truly, each and every one, my role models and mentors.This experience helped me hone in on my vocation: animal welfare. I will continue this mission as I manage patient care as a veterinary assistant, volunteer with animal welfare organizations, and reduce my carbon footprint. The summer of 2022 is when I submitted my veterinary school applications, so I will find out if I can become a veterinarian and make an even bigger difference this spring!For the last two goals, I am continually working on my public speaking and poise, especially when it comes to discussing my heritage. As a biracial kid growing up in mostly white spaces with Chinese grandparents that don\u2019t like to talk about the pain of the past, Miss Chinese Chicago truly introduced me to the Chicago AAPI community. I look forward to growing as a community member to better serve you in the next year.With unending gratitude,Natalie Chin\n", "\nI'm so proud to represent curvier Asian American women as your Miss Chinese Chicago 2022 Second Princess!

Jean Elliott here and I am SO excited to be your Miss Chinese Chicago\u2019s Miss Con(Jean)iality of 2022.\u00a0 As a transracial Chinese adoptee, I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to grow up with a consistent Chinese community. When I moved to Chicago I proactively immersed myself in a community that I found within Chinatown and Miss Chinese Chicago. The friendship, joy, and support that I found from contestants, Lin, Kim, Ava, Mary, Victoria, Natalie, Mia, and Isabel is beyond words!\u00a0Even though my parents could not personally offer me a community that looked like me, they cleared the path for me to find strength in other paths like soccer and sewing. These two activities have always been strong pillars in my personal foundation. I plan on using both activities to continue to uplift myself and the community that I now have the privilege of being a part of. I hope to bring that same love and support I received from the other contestants and the strength I have found through soccer and sewing to the greater Chinese community as your 2022 Miss Congeniality.Jean Elliott\n", "\nThe Miss Chinese Chicago was founded by Victoria M.

Because of our founder and producer Victoria Ng, I was able to get out of my comfort zone and be unapologetically myself. Before, I would always try to mold myself to be the \"perfect Chinese woman\" that society wanted me to be, but after training hours on end with Victoria, she made me realize that I felt the most beautiful and confident when I was myself.\"\"What started as a challenge to push myself outside of my comfort zone became an avenue for me to gain both a sisterhood of strong and resilient women and a platform to empower Chinese individuals to better understand and manage their health. As a physician-in-training, this opportunity to engage with the Chinese community in a way that allows them to lead healthier lives is invaluable, and I don\u2019t take it for granted.\"\n\n\n\nMegan Wu\n\n2019 Miss Chinese Chicago First PrincessBrittany Lau\n2018 Miss Chinese Chicago Queen & Congeniality\n2019 Miss Chinatown USA Community Service & Congeniality\n\n\n\n\"I have seen myself slowly grown into a woman I\u2019d never imagine I\u2019d become: a person who is confident in her own skin, voices out for what she is passionate about, and most importantly, an active female Chinese American community leader who is making a difference.\"Although it seemed like a small gesture, I was reminded that even though I felt alone at work, because of my ethnicity and gender, I was not alone in the fight for women\u2019s empowerment. With her encouragement, and kindness from my pageant director, I reported the cases of sexual harassment to my manager. With the confidence I gained from this experience, I started to consider applying for a role at a company where would my abilities as a female Asian American engineer would be celebrated, not just tolerated.\"\n\n\nPamela Yuan\n\n2019 Miss Chinese Chicago QueenAlly Moraga\n2019 Asian Fashion Show Chicago Model\n\n\"I felt immensely supported by this community as well as by the coordinators of the event. They made sure to guide us towards success and make us feel confident and beautiful as Asian women. Not everyone gets the chance to be a model for a day. I am very thankful for the opportunity to participate in the 2019 Asian Fashion Show.\"Celina Xu\n\n2019 Miss Chinese Chicago Congeniality & Crowd Favorite\n2020 Miss Chinatown USA Congeniality\"I have seen myself slowly grown into a woman I\u2019d never imagine I\u2019d become: a person who is confident in her own skin, voices out for what she is passionate about, and most importantly, an active female Chinese American community leader who is making a difference.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJade Lun\n\n2019 Miss Chinese Chicago Second Princess\n2020 Miss Chinatown USA Third Princess"], "https://chi-awe.org/sisterhood": ["Chicago Asian Women Empowerment\n\nChicago Asian Women Empowerment\n\nsisterhood\n\nWe foster a supportive space where aapi women can empower each other\n\nFEMALE VOICES\"As a larger Asian American woman and married, I didn't see myself as a beauty pageant contestant. But Miss Chinese Chicago, now Miss Asian Chicago, is not a beauty pageant. It's an empowering experience that strengthens you in public speaking, poise, knowledge of Asian American issues, connection with Chicago Asian American community, and sisterhood.\"\nVictoria Li\n\n2022 Miss Chinese Chicago Second Princess & Talent\"Pageantry taught me that sisterhood is about respecting each other, thinking about one another, and celebrating our wins together. Throughout this pageant journey, I\u2019ve experienced many kindness from my pageant sisters. During this whole experience, the support was real.\"\n\nJulie Zheng\n\n2019 Miss Chinese Chicago Contestant\nRead Julie's Medium Article\"Before Miss Chinese Chicago (now Miss Asian Chicago) I\u2019d never considered myself \u201cpageant material.\u201d In my head, \u201cpageant girls\u201d always wore lots of makeup and had to give their looks painstaking attention - something I have very little interest in. But with Miss Asian Chicago, I can come exactly as I am. Victoria and everyone else in the process - including my amazing pageant sisters - created a supportive space for me to be my messy self while I learned more about my values and polished my presentation skills. If you\u2019re not interested in making more friends in the Asian community, if you\u2019re not willing to go outside your comfort zone and learn, Miss Asian Chicago is not for you. But if you\u2019re ready to grow and learn more about yourself, submitting that application is going to be a turning point in your life. That\u2019s what this experience has been for me.\"\nNatalie Chin\n\n2022 Miss Chinese Chicago First Princess\"I remember the day before the Miss Chinese Chicago pageant, and I was feeling insecure about being intimidating to the judges since I have such a strong work history for Chinatown. However, a pageant sister, Natalie Chin, came up and talked to me about reframing and reclaiming ownership of the word intimidating as a powerful woman. There were many instances of support these ladies provided throughout the pageant. I went on a double date, had nights out dancing, cried over the phone, sought and received affirmation and advice, and my emotional and physical safety was always prioritized. These instances were not only inspiring but absolutely healing for me. I hold these lessons and affection dear to my heart as I am now the 2022 Queen of Miss Chinese Chicago and will proceed in fulfilling my platform of racial healing in the greater Chinatown area.\"\nXiao Lin Mei\n\n2022 Miss Chinese Chicago Queen & Crowd Favorite\"MCC has taught me the importance of friendship, giving back, and supporting each other. Thank you to everyone for believing in me and supporting me here today! After MCC, I will continue my work of empowering and educating the next generation of future leaders.\"\nMia Hitterman\n2022 Miss Chinese Chicago Contestant\n2023 Miss Chinatown USA Community Service"]}
